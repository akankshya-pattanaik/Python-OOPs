        "Ans:\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which represent real-world entities. These objects contain data (attributes/properties) and behavior (methods/functions).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation\n",
        "- Bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).\n",
        "- Restricts direct access to some data for security and controlled interaction.\n",
        "- Example: A bank account class where balance is private and can only be modified through deposit/withdraw methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstraction\n",
        "- Hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features.\n",
        "- Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
        "- Example: A \"Car\" class exposes drive() and brake() methods without showing the internal engine mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance\n",

        "4. Polymorphism\n",
        "- The ability of objects to take many forms.\n",
        "- Methods can be defined in multiple ways (overriding/overloading).\n",
        "- Example: The method sound() behaves differently for Dog (barks) and Cat (meows)."

        "Method Chaining in Python OOP:\n",
        "- Method chaining is an object-oriented programming technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code.\n",
        "- Each method returns the object itself (usually self), so the next method can be called immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "How It Works:\n",
        "- Normally, methods return a value (string, number, etc.).\n",
        "- In method chaining, methods return the object (self).\n",
        "- This allows calling another method directly after the previous one.\n",

        "- The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
